Covid Web App To Do List:
1.DONE Standardise dateformat (YYYYMMDD)
	DONE- Change SRC links in script, style, etc tags
	--Possible extra improvement, consolidate all the libraries into one lib folder, but idk if the juice is worth the squeeze atp
2. Index Page to link to all reports 
+ give summary 
+ credit 
+ more info 
+ link back to MRC page
3. (Ideally) include navigation panel/bar/menu and footers on every page, but that might be a bit tedious
4. In theory there is probably a way to standardise all the pages into one and inject the logic in with a sort of framework-style approach but that's probably way too much to ask
5. Set up for GH Pages + learn about GH Pages 


NOTES:
HTML files seem to be linked to their respective folders (this only applies to some of them, I am not sure if this is an R thing or something else, but it's weird and annoying) and un-linking the folder (i.e. changing the src path) seems to break the pages, deleting the folders likewise has a similar effect, which is expected. I'm not sure if that means we just have to always keep all these folders, which is fine but not ~*~ perfect ~*~, but if GH has a size limit it might be an issue. Suppose we will address this as needed.
